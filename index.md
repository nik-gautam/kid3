## Introduction

If you want to easily tag multiple MP3, Ogg/Vorbis, FLAC, MPC, MP4/AAC, MP2, Opus, Speex, TrueAudio, WavPack, WMA, WAV and AIFF files (e.g. full albums) without typing the same information again and again and have control over both ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags, then Kid3 is the program you are looking for.

## Features

Kid3
With Kid3 you can:

- Edit ID3v1.1 tags
- Edit all ID3v2.3 and ID3v2.4 frames
- Convert between ID3v1.1, ID3v2.3 and ID3v2.4 tags
- Edit tags in MP3, Ogg/Vorbis, DSF, FLAC, MPC, MP4/AAC, MP2, Opus, Speex, TrueAudio, WavPack, WMA, WAV, AIFF files and tracker modules (MOD, S3M, IT, XM)
- Edit tags of multiple files, e.g. the artist, album, year and genre of all files of an album typically have the same values and can be set together.
- Generate tags from filenames
- Generate tags from the contents of tag fields
- Generate filenames from tags
- Rename and create directories from tags
- Generate playlist files
- Automatically convert upper and lower case and replace strings
- Import from [gnudb.org](http://gnudb.org/), [TrackType.org](http://tracktype.org/), [MusicBrainz](http://musicbrainz.org/), [Discogs](http://discogs.com/), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) and other sources of album data
- Export tags as CSV, HTML, playlists, Kover XML and in other formats
- Edit synchronized lyrics and event timing codes, import and export LRC files
- Automate tasks using QML/JavaScript, D-Bus or the command-line interface

</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td nowrap="nowrap">24 Aug 2019</td>
<td>3.8.0</td>
<td>The CLI now supports JSON for input and output and is independent of any GUI libraries. Other improvements concern better compatibility with iTunes. The import from tags function can now operate on all selected files and return extracted values to scripts.
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td nowrap="nowrap">18 Mar 2019</td>
<td>3.7.1</td>

</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td nowrap="nowrap">23 Dec 2018</td>
<td>3.7.0</td>
<td>The most important new feature is a playlist editor. Playlist items can be added, removed and reordered. Improvements include editors for the formats to convert between tags and file names and drop down lists with available tag values when multiple files are selected.

<td>3.6.2</td>
<td>This bugfix release fixes the use of free form MP4 atoms, import from CSV with DOS line endings, the application icon in KDE wayland sessions and other bugs.

</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td nowrap="nowrap">23 Apr 2018</td>
<td>3.6.1</td>
<td>This bugfix release improves the speed when saving with a lot of unchanged files in the directory.

</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">

</td>
</tr>
 <tr valign="top">
<td nowrap="nowrap">18 Feb 2017</td>
<td>3.4.5</td>
<td>This bugfix release brings improvements with handling lots of files. File tree expansion and filtering are significantly faster and consume less memory. Folders can be explicitly excluded or included. Importing from MusicBrainz and Discogs has been fixed.
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td nowrap="nowrap">23 Dec 2016</td>
<td>3.4.4</td>

</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td nowrap="nowrap">1 Nov 2016</td>
<td>3.4.3</td>
<td>Tagging of WAV files is improved by supporting ID3v2.3.0 tags on WAV files and better interoperability with RIFF INFO tags by configuring the track field to be "ITRK" and the RIFF chunk to use a lowercase "id3 " name. The latest iTunes tags for classical music are now supported. Bug fixes solve crashes with FLAC files and support for translated names and the 3rd tag in kid3-cli.
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td nowrap="nowrap">24 Aug 2016</td>
<td>3.4.2</td>
<td>This bugfix release fixes issues with copy pasting of tags with multiple frames of the same type (e.g. multiple artists) and deleting frames in kid3-cli.

</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td nowrap="nowrap">24 Jun 2016</td>
<td>3.4.1</td>
<td>This bugfix release fixes the wrong marking of ID3v2 Date frames as modified and makes it possible to directly add Date frames with ISO date/time values to files which do not yet have an ID3v2.4.0, M4A or Vorbis tag. For the Windows version, issues with incorrect relative paths in playlists, importing from Discogs and temporary files generated by id3lib were fixed.
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td nowrap="nowrap">23 Apr 2016</td>
<td>3.4.0</td>

</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td nowrap="nowrap">9 Nov 2014</td>
<td>3.1.2</td>
<td>This bug fix release offers the possibility to change the permissions when trying to save read-only files. It fixes bugs like editing a frame for multiple files which do not all already have such a frame or the use of special characters in M4A files on Windows. The number of open file descriptors is reduced, which should solve problems when working with a huge number of files. The Discogs import has been updated to address the latest restrictions.
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td nowrap="nowrap">24 Aug 2014</td>
<td>3.1.1</td>
